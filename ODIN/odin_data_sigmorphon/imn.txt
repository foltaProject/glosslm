He went away again.                 The woman followed him.    She followed him and followed him and followed him, watching him closely.       He descended into his grave. The earth having opened, there he descended again into his grave. Into his own grave.           Having descended, the woman looked, there he descended.      She looked and came back.       Having looked and returned, she came back again.      Her husband arrived.       Her husband       having arrived, well! Bring me my food!       J am hungry. I am hungry.                       Bring me my food!       She said: what food again.        You have eaten your food       earlier on.      Your food is gone.     No, when did I come earlier.                       It is only now that I arrive here.      Oh! You stay on       your own!         I talked to the boys        to the boys in vain, one is coming or not, but no, the boys simply        listened, but did not come. I came on my own.                     And then.        Homeward.         He ate that food and then went home.       They went.     Having gone home, at night she was       dying.     She having died at night, her husband worked magic.       The boys simply did, completely did, completely died.       There was none of them, none of them left, all of the boys died.       Because of that I worked magic, one should have followed her.
